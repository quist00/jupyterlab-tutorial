# What is JupyterLab?
- Web-based interactive environment
- Supports interleaving functioal code with data exploration and presentation in single portable file
- Can run Python, R, Julia, and more
- Excellent tool for data science and teaching

# Jupyter on your hardware
- Takes more work to setup
- Limited to your hardware, but data never leaves your computer

# Jupyter Cloud Based
- Many options
  - Google Colab
  - Kaggle Notebooks
  - Azure Notebooks
  - continued . . .
