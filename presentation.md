# Introduction to JupyterLab
- What is it?
- How can you access it?
- Interface Basics  

# What is JupyterLab?
- Browser-based interactive environment
- Supports interleaving functioal code with data exploration and presentation in single portable file
- Can run Python, R, Julia, and more
- Excellent tool for data science and teaching

# Jupyter on your hardware
- Takes more work to setup
- Limited to your hardware, but data never leaves your computer

# Jupyter Cloud Based
- Many options
  - Google Colab
  - Kaggle Notebooks
  - Azure Notebooks
  - Binder
  - GitHub Codespaces
  - Jupyterhub aka Titan Computing Hub

# Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- No local installation needed
- Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Go to your [JupyterHub URL](https://www.fullerton.edu/it/services/software/jupyter)
  
# Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- Select `Launch JupyterHUB`
- Select `JupyterHub (Nautilus)
- Log in with campus credentials
  - Select Campus from provider dropdown

# Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- set minimum hardware requirements
- press start
- wait for instance to go live
  - you start with 5gb space
  - filling it can stop your isntances from launching
 
# Closing JupyterLab
- The slide so important you will see it twice :)
- Save your work: File > Save Notebook
- Log out via Hub control panel (File Menu)
- Session persists until timeout (set by admin)
- Reconnect by revisiting JupyterHub URL
  
# JupyterLab Interface
- **Menu Bar**: File, Edit, View, Run options
- **Left Side Bar**: File browser, running kernels, extensions
- **Main Work Area**: Notebooks, terminals, or text editors

# Demo: Leveraging other's work
[GLAM Workbench Wikidata Example](https://glam-workbench.net/wikidata/)
- notes just for me
  - `source venv/bin/activate`
  - `python -m jupyter lab`  

# Operations, Tips, Shortcuts
- Making a markdown cell
- Making a code cell
- Running cells
- Command mode and keyboard shortcuts

# Closing JupyterLab
- Save your work: File > Save Notebook
- Log out via Hub control panel (File Menu)
- Session persists until timeout (set by admin)
- Reconnect by revisiting JupyterHub URL

# Where to go from here
- Experiment on JupyterHub to gauge its utility
- Learn to install and leverage locally
  - [Take a Carpentries class that uses jupyter](https://carpentries.org/workshops/upcoming-workshops/)
- Self-study on [linked in learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introducing-jupyter/present-data-like-a-pro-with-jupyter)
- Return to JupyterHub if and when you find it is the best fit for your research needs
