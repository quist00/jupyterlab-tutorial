# Introduction to JupyterLab
- A 30-minute overview
- Using JupyterHub for access
- Based on Carpentries "Plotting and Programming in Python"

## What is JupyterLab?
- Web-based interactive environment
- Part of the Jupyter project
- Supports notebooks, code, and data exploration
- Runs Python, R, Julia, and more
- Ideal for data science and teaching

## Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- No local installation needed
- Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Go to your JupyterHub URL (e.g., `https://hub.example.org`)
- Log in with provided credentials
- Select JupyterLab from the launcher interface

## JupyterLab Interface
- **Menu Bar**: File, Edit, View, Run options
- **Left Side Bar**: File browser, running kernels, extensions
- **Main Work Area**: Notebooks, terminals, or text editors
- Flexible layout for multitasking

## Kernels in JupyterLab
- Separate processes for executing code
- Default kernel: Often Python 3 (depends on Hub setup)
- Other options: R, Julia (if configured by admin)
- Switch kernels via Kernel menu or launcher

## Closing JupyterLab
- Save your work: File > Save Notebook
- Log out via Hub control panel (top-right, usually)
- Session persists until timeout (set by admin)
- Reconnect by revisiting JupyterHub URL
