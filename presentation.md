## What is JupyterLab?
- Web-based interactive environment
- Supports interleavingfunctioal code with data exploration and presentation in single portable file
- Runs Python, R, Julia, and more
- Excellent tool for data science and teaching

## How can you leverage Jupyter
- Local Computer
  -Takes more work, limited to your hardware, but data never leaves your computer
- Google Collab
- JupyterLite
- Jupyterhub aka Titan Computing Hub

## Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- No local installation needed
- Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Go to your JupyterHub URL (e.g., `https://www.fullerton.edu/it/services/software/jupyter`)
- Select `Launch JupyterHUB` from the launcher interface
- Select `JupyterHub (Nautilus)
- Log in with campus credentials (Select Campus from provider dropdown)

## Accessing JupyterLab via JupyterHub
- set minimum hardware requirements
- press start
- wait for instance to go live
    - you start with 5gb space
    - filling it can stop your isntances from launching

## JupyterLab Interface
- **Menu Bar**: File, Edit, View, Run options
- **Left Side Bar**: File browser, running kernels, extensions
- **Main Work Area**: Notebooks, terminals, or text editors
- Flexible layout for multitasking

## Kernels in JupyterLab
- Separate processes for executing code
- Default kernel: Often Python 3 (depends on Hub setup)
- Other options: R, Julia (if configured by admin)
- Switch kernels via Kernel menu or launcher

## Closing JupyterLab
- Save your work: File > Save Notebook
- Log out via Hub control panel (top-right, usually)
- Session persists until timeout (set by admin)
- Reconnect by revisiting JupyterHub URL
